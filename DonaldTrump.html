        <h2>COVID-19</h2>
        <p><b>Believes COVID will just go away.</b>
            Rejecting science and the realities of the pandemic,
            Trump and his administration failed to prepare the country for the virus.
            Instead, he has complained that “Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,”
            and ordered Senate Republicans “to toughen up or they’ll lose in November.”</p>
    
        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>Doubts whether climate change is man-made. He has removed a number of environmental requirements and
            regulations while president. Wants more production of coal and oil in the US.</p>
    
        <h2>Healthcare</h2>
        <p><b>Promises, promises.</b>
            His handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a major public health crisis,
            but Trump has stated that “we’re signing a health-care plan within two weeks,
            a full and complete health-care plan.” Although he did not meet his deadline
            and has not released a new plan to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA),
            his first term accomplishments include cutting funding to programs that help
            underserved communities access healthcare services.</p>
    
        <h2>Higher education funding</h2>
        <p><b>Supports some funding increases, but annually calls for sizable reductions in federal research spending.</b>
            In his FY 2021 budget, Trump’s calls for a nearly $900 million increase in career
            and technical education funding and adds $830 million to National Science Foundation
            funding for artificial intelligence-related grants and interdisciplinary research institutes.
            However, for the fourth straight year, Trump also recommended making deep cuts (from 6.5 to 23.6 percent)
            to the budgets of the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation,
            and to science programs at the Department of Energy and NASA.</p>
